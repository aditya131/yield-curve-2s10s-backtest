# Yield Curve 2s10s Steepener Strategy

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project backtests a yield curve steepener/flattener strategy using the 2s10s slope constructed from front SOFR futures. The strategy uses z-score signals for entry/exit and scales exposure by DV01.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
- Construct the 2s10s curve using front SOFR futures  
- Compute z-scores of the slope to trigger trades  
- Enter long (steepener) or short (flattener) positions based on threshold crossings  
- Scale trade exposure dynamically using DV01  
- Generate cumulative PnL and Sharpe ratio  
- Plot strategy signals, slope evolution, and performance
